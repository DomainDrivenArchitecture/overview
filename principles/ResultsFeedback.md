# Clear results feedback

While we always hope for success, we all know too well that things can go wrong with software.   
To be able to solve potential problems it is important to get clear information e.g. about the steps performed and even more important about where it might gone wrong and especially why. 
Preferably potential solutions should be named.
So, while for successful executions it is nice to have, in case of errors it is essential to get a clear results overview.
