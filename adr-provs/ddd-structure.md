# ddd structure

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We wanted to have a consistent structure.

## Decision

* We preliminarily use the ddd structure: application / domain / infrastructure
  * Reservation 1: find a better name for domain
  * Reservation 2: decide what to put in domain / what to cover with unit tests
